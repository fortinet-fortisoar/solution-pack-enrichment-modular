# Modular Enrichment Playbooks
This collection is dedicated to a modular approach to enrichment playbooks. A primary enrichment playbook is responsible for all indicator types enrichment.
For each type several referenced playbooks are used to perform the enrichment from a single cyber threat intelligence source.
The primary playbook collects enrichment data from all references playbooks and computes the indicator attributes.
